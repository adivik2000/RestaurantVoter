RestaurantVoter is a website that helps co-workers decide where to eat for lunch.
No longer do people waste 15 minutes around the water cooler trying to decide what
to do for lunch. Instead, each person place their vote for lunch on the website.
RestaurantVoter will only present a few of the many lunch options each day. This
prevents the same restaurant from winning every day as well as ensuring users aren't
overloaded with choices.

BUILDING RestaurantVoter
All the code that is hosted is inside of a Netbeans project. As such,
you will get the best results by using Netbeans to work with the site.
In the future, it might be interesting to strip all the source files out
and not have the Netbeans project in the repo, but for now, I'm using
Netbeans so will just commit project files.

RUNNING RestaurantVoter
Before you can run RestaurantVoter, you must configure it's database
connection. Find DatabaseConnector.java.TEMPLATE and edit the JDBC
connection string to point to your own database and save the changes
under DatabaseConnection.java in the same directory.

It should go without saying, to run this site, you will also need a
Java container. I'm using Glassfish 3, but Tomcat should work as well.

HOSTING RestaurantVoter
Will be finished later.
